# SimiOS

**An actual OS, only written in assembly.**
##### Reasons why you should work with the SimiOS-Kernel as a beginner:
1. It can realy boot, so you can say, that you made your own OS
2. It  is easy to understand and has a documantation about things i had to struggle with.
3. It doesn't include anything, only the boot.asm.


### The Documentation:
*Go to the "build_and_boot.bat", all documented and boot things are in this batch file.*

### Install

**Go to the release tab and download the 01.rar file. Then boot from a real computer or virtual machine.**
